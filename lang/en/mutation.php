    'destroy_fuel_tank.description' => <<<MD
Destroys a fuel tank, returning the storage deposit and any remaining balance to the fuel tank owner.  

**Prerequisites:**  
- The fuel tank must be frozen before it can be destroyed.  
- All Tank User Accounts must be removed prior to destruction.  

Failure to meet these conditions will cause the transaction to fail.

    'insert_rule_set.description' => <<<MD
Inserts a new rule set into a fuel tank or replaces an existing one.  

**Important Considerations:**  
- If replacing a rule set, a rule that stores data on user accounts might cause the operation to fail. [Learn more](https://docs.enjin.io/docs/fuel-tank-pallet#insert_rule_set).  
- Adding a rule set requires the fuel tank to be frozen; otherwise, the operation will fail.

    'remove_rule_set.description' => <<<MD
Removes a rule set from a fuel tank.  

**Important Considerations:**  
- Rule sets storing data on any accounts cannot be removed and will result in an error. Use the `RemoveAccountRuleData` mutation to clear the data first.
